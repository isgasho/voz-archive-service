Mercato: a Sainsbury's Scraper in Go
=====


# DISCLAIMER :warning:
*Please be aware that Sainsbury's code reviewers are aware of this project and could compare it against your submission. Take inspiration if you want, but don't copy it: be creative instead! :-)*

## Logic
Mercato is a console application intended to scrape a Saynsbury's test page and grab every product's url children page for additional information.

This task could be completed with PHP, Java or Go. However, Go seems the better and logic candidate because of the possibility to run every scrape request as a concurrent goroutine, thus augmenting the response time.

### Notes

#### GoRoutines order
When we are scraping the store's page, the order of each product in the final JSON object *will not* be the same as the order of appearance on the page. This is because of the GoRoutine's concurrency: the actual order will probably be determined by the responsiveness of the queried page.

If the order of the products in the final JSON object should be the same as the one of the grocery store page, it will be necessary to add an `order` param on the struct `sainsburys.Product` and then implement an order `func` afterwards.

Because of time restraints, this has been left out.

## Dependencies
- `go` installed and `GOPATH` variable well set up. For more info visit  [Go's documentation](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)

### Installation

```bash
